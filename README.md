# Book Class with User Input

This Ruby program shows how to:

- Create a class (`Book`)
- Use `initialize` to set object values
- Use `attr_accessor` for reading/writing attributes
- Take input from the user using `gets.chomp`
- Convert input using `.to_i`
- Print a details using object data

## How it works

1. User is asked to enter book title, author, and number of pages.
2. A `Book` object is created with that data.
3. A `details` method prints the book details.
